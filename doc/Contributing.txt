Here the guidelines for contributions will be laid out:

1: The code must adhere to the [Felix's Node style guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide). One exception is allowed: to nest ONE callback. When done so, the nested function that uses a callback must be surrounded by comments so its clear where it lives and dies.

2: The code must be formatted using the eclipse formatting configured in the projet.

3: The code cannot display any warning according to the lint configured in the project.

4: Multiple functions that are part of an operation must be grouped into a section using comments if the module contains more than just this operation.

5: Functions cannot be called before they are declared.

6: No prototyping.

7: Every function on the engine modules must be on exports so addons can overwrite them.

8: No single file can contain more than 1k LOC.

9: Every single template, language, form api and database spec must be documented on its respective document.
