The json api expects serialized json objects with the following structure on requests:

{
    auth:{
        user:"User login goes here",
        hash:"User hash goes here"},
    parameters:{keys and values to be sent},
    captchaId: "Id of current captcha",
    bypassId: "Id of the current block bypass"
}

And will respond with serialized json objects with the following structure:

{
    auth:{
        authStatus:"Status of authentication",
        newHash: "Possible new hash for the user",
        expiration: "Possible new date for the expiration of the session"},
    status:"status of the operation",
    data: "Any kind of data to be returned will be in this field"
}

The authstatus can be either 'ok' or 'expired', in which case the user hash must be replaced by the content of 'newHash' and 'expiration' will tell for how long the hash will be valid.

The global status are:
    bypassable: user has been prevented from posting but its possible for him to use the block bypass to post.
    error: internal server occurred. The error string will be on the data field.
    blank: parameter was sent in blank. The parameter will be on the data field.

    ok: operation successful.
    maintenance: site is going under maintenance.
    formatNotAllowed: an uploaded file has a format that is now allowed.

        reason: the reason of the ban.

        expiration(Date): when the ban expires.
        appealled(Boolean): indicates if the ban has been already appealed.

        file: name provided for the file.
        boardUri: board uri of the hash ban. If not informed, the file is banned globally.

The back-end will truncate strings longer than the maximum length.
Files should be sent in a parameter called 'files' containing an array where each object contains the following fields:
spoiler(Boolean): indicates that the individual file should be spoiled without making all files in the post spoilered. Only used for posting threads or replies.
name: original name of the file.
