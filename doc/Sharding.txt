Sharding is the capability of the engine to run as a distributed system, with a single master and several slaves.

WORKFLOW
The master has two roles:

1: to act as a load balancer, passing requests to the slaves.
2: to distribute the centralized queue for generating pages.

The first item is fairly simple, the master just acts as a reverse-proxy. Currently, it is unable to pass requests using https to slaves, that should be eventually fixed. However, it is able to pass incoming https requests using plain http to slaves. So you can either trust no one will sniff your traffic between slaves and the master or deploy webservers to take in http and pass using https to slaves.

The requests will be passed using the port the master is listening to when using http and 443 when using https (when its fixed, of course). 
So if your master listens on port 8080, it will try to pass the request to slaves on port 8080.

The second item works as follows:
Worker process on a slave triggers a page regeneration and send it to master process.
Master process sends regeneration message to master node using http.
Master node receives the message on a worker process using the page /takeMessage.js and sends it to master process.
Master process on master node queues the message or discards it.
Master process sends the regeneration message to a slave node.
Slave node receives the message on a worker process and generates the page.

This way, the I/O is kept as efficient as possible, because there will be still a single queue, instead of each server having its own queue an possibily building the same pages at the same time.

SETTING UP

First, deploy all the servers you want to have running. Slaves will rebuild pages, so having them with a good CPU is desirable.

Then on the slaves, log as a root user and on the global settings, input the ip of the master server on the correct field. If the slave is not running under a webserver, your next request won't be served, because slaves only serve requests to localhost and their master. So if you are running a slave under a webserver, you should restrict requests from any server but the master on it.

Now on the master, input the ips of the slaves on the correct field using the screen for global settings. The master will update the settings of any slave that you set. If your master is running under a webserver, you should configure the webserver to block any requests to '/.api/takeMessage' on the master from any ip but the slaves.
