      <h1>Global moderation</h1>
      Any account have a numeric global role assigned to it. If this role is
      lesser than 4, it means the user is in the global staff.
      <br>
      Root: 0
      <br>
      Admin: 1
      <br>
      Volunteer: 2
      <br>
      Janitor: 3
      <br>
      Anything above 3 or undefined is considered a regular user. Janitors are
      able to delete any post or thread on the site and to close global reports.
      <br>
      Volunteers are able able to lift and issue any kind of global ban.
      <br>
      Admins are able to add or remove volunteers and janitors, to delete and
      transfer boards. They are also able to create boards when board creation
      is disabled.
      <br>
      Roots are able to assign admins.
      <br>
      The first admin or root will have to have it's role set using the terminal
      arguments. Consult the readme.md on src/be for instructions on that. Any
      role have all the powers of the less <span title="[TRIGGER WARNING] :^)">privileged</span>
      roles. When your account has access to the global staff tools, a link on
      your account page will be displayed.

      <h1>Board moderation</h1>
      A board have it's board owner and board volunteers. Board volunteers are
      added by the board owner and are able to delete content on the board,
      lock, pin, make threads cyclic, close board reports, change board
      settings, and apply bans for the board.
      <br>
      Board owners are able to do that, plus they are able to transfer or delete
      their own boards, add board banners, filters, custom css and rules.

      <h1>Custom CSS</h1>
      Board owners can add a css file to their boards, just using the upload
      form on the board management page. To delete the custom css file, click
      the upload button without entering any files.

      <h1>Reports</h1>
      Any non-banned user is able to report content, as long as said content
      haven't been reported yet.
      <br>
      Open reports will be displayed on the main moderation page with a link to
      the reported content and a button to close the report.
      <br>
      Closed reports are not deleted until the content they relate to is
      deleted. It is also possible to ask for the engine to delete the reported
      content when closing the reports.

      <h1>Deleting content</h1>
      As long as you are logged in, your global role and board role will be
      verified when you try to delete content AS LONG AS YOU DON'T INPUT A
      PASSWORD.
      <br>
      If you input a password, your account will not be validated and the system
      will try to use the deletion password you provided.
      <br>
      Not only its possible to delete content, but also to only delete the files
      posted on the content.
      <br>
      Regular file deletion will just remove the reference to the file, while
      media deletion will actually wipe the file from the site. Media deletion
      is only usable by global staff.
      <br>
      Global staff is also allowed to use a clear IP to delete content from this
      IP across the whole site. Board staff can use IP deletion, but it will be
      restricted to the board of the first selected post to be deleted by IP
      deletion.

      <h1>Acessing moderation tools</h1>
      When you open a thread, there will be a link that will lead you to the
      moderation page for that board and thread, with all the moderation tools
      for that thread.

      <h1>Thread settings</h1>
      Threads have 3 settings: pin, lock and cyclic.
      <br>
      Pin will make a thread be listed above all others, no matter how long it
      was it's last bump.
      <br>
      Lock will prevent anyone from posting on a thread.
      <br>
      Cyclic will make the thread never get into auto-sage. Instead it will
      delete old posts when it hits the post limit that would trigger auto-sage.

      <h1 id="banSection">Bans</h1>
      To apply bans, select the checkboxes on the left top corner of postings
      and write a duration for the ban. The format used is the following:
      <br>
      <b>y</b>: amount of years.
      <br>
      <b>M</b>: amount of months.
      <br>
      <b>d</b>: amount of days.
      <br>
      <b>h</b>: amount of hours.
      <br>
      <b>m</b>: amount of minutes.
      <br>
      So if you write "2d 1h" it will create a 49 hour ban. The order of amounts
      and spacing doesn`t matter. The same could be "1h 2d".
      <br>
      Board staff is also required to fill the captcha.
      <br>
      Bans can be lifted from the bans page that can be accessed from the
      moderation pages.
      <br>
      Optionally, you can enter the ban reason and message. The ban message will
      be displayed on the post itself instead of the default ban message set in
      the site configurations. Global staff with the power to apply bans can
      select the checkbox to apply a global ban.
      <br>
      The ban reason will appear for both the user and on the bans list.

      <h1>Range bans</h1>
      It is also possible to ban entire ranges of ips. When banning an user,
      select the ban mode. Range bans can use either the first half or the first
      three quarters of the user ip. Alternatively, it is possible to manually
      ban a known IP on the range bans page.

      <h1>Hash bans</h1>
      Files can also be banned, keeping anyone from posting them. Copy the sha256
      of the file shown in the thread moderation page and input it on the hash
      bans page.

      <h1>Board settings</h1>
      There are many ways to customize how a board works in general.
      <br>
      The [code] tag allows for posts to transform text in this tag into a
      non-formated text that is best used to display code.
      <br>
      The name used for anonymous posters, board name and description can also
      be changed.
      <br>
      Board message will be displayed above the posting form and accepts any
      most of posting markdown plus custom links using [displayed
      text](address).
      <br>
      Adding a custom CSS will cause this file to be used after all other CSS
      files on board, thread and catalog of the board.
      <br>
      A custom JS can only be added if allowed by the global setings.
      <br>
      A custom spoiler will replace any spoiled files on the board.
      <br>
      Location flags can be toggled. They won't work if the site doesn't have
      the location data installed.
      <br>
      Custom flags can be selected by users when they post, being shown in place
      of a flag representing their location.
      <br>
      Tags will be shown on the board listing and can be used to search for
      boards.
      <br>
      Captcha mode allows for greater control on when an user has to use a
      captcha to post. Not only is possible to set for captchas to be required
      always or never, but it's also possible to set it to be used only when
      creating threads.
      <br>
      Textboard mode will disable the uploading of files entirely. It is also
      possible for users be required to always upload at least one file when
      creating a new thread.
      <br>
      Unique files and posts will require that users do not upload files that
      are already present on the board or that post similar posts.
      <br>
      By default users have an id unique to them inside threads, this feature
      can be disabled for greater anonymity.
      <br>
      If you set users to not be allowed to delete their own posts, only staff
      members will be allowed to delete them.
      <br>
      If forced anonymity is toggled, then users won't be able to use a name
      when posting. They will still be allowed to use role signatures, however.
      <br>
      Early 404 will cause threads that have less than 5 replies to be deleted
      when they leave the top third threads.
      <br>
      It is possible to make some posting more strict than the global values:
      <br>
      Amount of files
      <br>
      Maximum size for files
      <br>
      Maximum amount of threads on the board
      <br>
      Maximum amount of replies on threads
      <br>
      Valid file formats that can be uploaded to the board.
      <br>
      Any value greater or not included on the global values will be ignored.

      <h1>Filters</h1>
      Filters change a term for another term.

      <h1>Banners</h1>
      One can add customized banners for a board, they will be displayed
      randomly for users.

      <h1>Rules</h1>
      Rules can be written and will be made visible on the rules.html page of
      the board.

      <h1>Board message markdown</h1>
      It is similar to standard posting markdown with some differences:
      <br>
      It won't handle quotes.
      <br>
      Links won't be handled the same way, you have to use standard markdown for
      them.
      <br>
      For example: [A link](http://hurr.durr) becomes
      <a href="http://hurr.durr">A link</a>
      <br>
      [code] tag won't be applied.
